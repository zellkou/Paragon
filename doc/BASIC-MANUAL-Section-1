                                                            MODEL 258-IBM
                                                     PARAGON SERIAL CONTROL PROGRAM

INTRODUCTION The Model 258-IBM is a software package which, when used with the optional Model 258 RS232 Interface, permits an IBM PC or compatible computer to remotely communicate with the Ten-Tec PARAGON 
transceiver. The program is written in Microsoft BASIC and requres that the user have the program BASICA.COM or the quivalent installed on the IBM PC.

PARTS SUPPLIED Enclosed in the Model 258-IBM package you should find the following items:
    1 - #258-IBM program 5 1/4" disk
    1 - #74189 Installation and Instruction manual.
    1 - Software REgistration Card

INSTALLATION INSTRUTIONS

    1. MAKE A BACKUP COPY The software provided is NOT Copy Protected and man easily be duplicated or installed on your hard disk. Refer to you computer DOS and user manuals for the steps required to 
backup disks and copy programs to your hard disk. Then place the Master disk in a safe place and only use the copy.
    2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Your IBM PC or compatible computer should have at least 256K of RAm and at least one RS232 Serial Communications Port available. You may use either a monochrome or color monitor, 
however, at this time color is not supported in the program. The Primary requirement for using the PARAGON program is that YOU MUST HAVE BASIC. If you have an IBM PC, this will be a program called 
BASICA.COM which came with the DOS. For IBM compatible computers this may be GWBASIC or some other form of BSIC.
    3. WHAT'S ON YOUR DISK The enclosed software disk will contain the main program PARAGON.BAS which has been saved in standard ASCII file format. There is also a small batch file which can be used to 
automatically load BASIC and run the PARAGON.BAS program. This file is called PARAGON.BAT. Depending on your directory structures, you may have to modify this batch file so that DOS can locate your 
BASICA.COM file. See your computers users manual if you have questions. If you don't want to worry about directories and sub-directories, simply install the BASICA.COM and PARAGON.BAS files in your root 
directory and type "PARAGON" to execute the batch file. A third file on your disk, called MEM1, contains a sample set of memories which can be read into the PARAGON program. There may also be a forth file 
called README.DOC, which will have any last minute corrections on instructions.
    4. CONNECT YOUR COMPUTER TO THE PARAGON After you have installed your Model 258 Interface and constructed the required interconnecting able you are ready to test everything. (If you have questions 
about installing your Model 258 or making the cable, see the Instructions provided with the Model 258). Connect the DB-25 Male connector to the mating connector on the rear of the PARAGON. Next locate the 
COM1 RS232 serial connector on your computer. This will normall be a DB-25 Male connector. (If it is not, you will have to change your connecting cable to match). Connect the free end of the 
interconnecting cable to this COM1 connector. NOTE:You may also use COM2 if you wish, but you will have to change line 110 in the program to read
        OPEN "COM2:1200,N,8,1,CS,DS,RS,CD" AS #1
    5. TESTING THE PROGRAM Apply power to your Computer  and also to the PARAGON. Turn ON the POWER switch on the PARAGON. The transceiver should power up as usual and you should be able to manually 
control all functions of the PARAGON. If you have problems, discconnect the interconnect cable and try again. If you still have problems refer to the Trouble Shooting section at the end of the 
instructions. Run PARAGON program and you should see the screen shown below. The FREQUENCY and VFO displayed may differ from that shown but they should be what is currently displayed on the PARAGON. If you 
get everything but the last line, the you may have a cabling problem and the computer is not receiving the status of the transceiver correctly (see Trouble Shooting section). If everything appears to be 
working you can select some of the menu items to exercise your PARAGON. The Menu Functions are covered in more detail in the next section.
